    <p>
      Through her years of working as a realtor as well as her personal
      experience in helping her parents and clients downsize, Rachel has learned
      that planning ahead is essential to any potential move. Too many of us
      wait too long to start editing, organizing and decluttering. The key is to
      think ahead and donâ€™t wait. Start your process now! Rachel is both a
      dedicated real estate agent and a move management consultant with a proven
      track record and over 25 years of experience in sales and marketing. She
      is committed to securing the best financial outcomes for her clients and
      has a proven track record of success in representing both buyers and
      sellers. Rachel has expertise in home renovation and is able to provide
      insightful advice to those buying or selling a property. She is a native
      of Boston and has lived in Wellesley for 20+ years, actively involved in
      her community through her membership in various programs and committees.
      Rachel and her family also own a home on Cape Cod and she is happy to
      assist buyers in their search for properties there.
