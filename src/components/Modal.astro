      downsize, Rachel has learned that planning ahead is essential to any potential move. Too many of us wait too long
      to start editing, organizing and decluttering. The key is to think ahead and donâ€™t wait. Start your process now!<br

      over 25 years of experience in sales and marketing. She is committed to securing the best financial outcomes for
      her clients and has a proven track record of success in representing both buyers and sellers. Rachel has expertise
      in home renovation and is able to provide insightful advice to those buying or selling a property. She is a native
      of Boston and has lived in Wellesley for 20+ years, actively involved in her community through her membership in
